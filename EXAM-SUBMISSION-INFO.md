**PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING:**

1. The code relevant to the data visualization is mostly located in the 'NDDE' directory. But feel free to look around :)

2. Hash of second to latest commit (because I will commit this change after updating file) as at the date of exam submission (26.01.2023, 15:00) = `1d6b235a7deb609533f6218333f06307d23fa9e0` (short: `1d6b235`) with message "Upload Exam Submission Info"

3. There seems to be a problem with the automated forwarded port url. Therefore on Loading my codespaces, on pwd = `/workspaces/Mediplus`, please run the following commands (on two separate Terminals)

`npx http-server /workspaces/Mediplus/NDDE -p 3000`         – for viewing the d3 visualization.  
`node /workspaces/Mediplus/disaster-news/app.mjs`           – if interested, for viewing the NDDE Top Disaster News


4. The sample data for visualization, as requested, are located in this repo at `Mediplus/NDDE/sample-data`. I provided both csv and json formats.

**NOTE:** Due to the large nature of file of the source file, I created the sample data to only visualize for the year 2020.
But these sample data can serve as good template for mass reproduction.


Thank you Prof,
